# SocialConnect - Premium Social Media Prototype

A high-fidelity prototype for JavaScript 2 Course Assignment

## Project Overview

This prototype serves as **design inspiration and technical reference** for our team's final course assignment. It demonstrates advanced UI/UX patterns, smooth animations, and clean code architecture that we can adapt for our production application.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend Technologies

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility best practices
- **CSS3**: Advanced styling with custom properties and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: ES6+ features, modular code structure
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for professional typography

## Important Notes

- **Educational Purpose**: This prototype is for learning and inspiration
- **Not Production Ready**: Missing security, scalability, and production features
- **Simulated Backend**: All data is mock data stored in memory
- **Course Compliance**: Final assignment must use required technologies (TypeScript, Vite, Noroff API)

Built with passion for JavaScript 2 course assignment
